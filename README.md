# Gale
A Zephyr demo that shows how to set up a multi-application project with a common interface. Liberally uses the many kernel features and other utilities provided by Zephyr (some simple things are occasionally over-engineered for the sake of demonstration).
- [Main repo](https://github.com/JaagupAverin/gale-main) - main west file and common code shared between the applications
- [Sensor app](https://github.com/JaagupAverin/gale-sensor-app) - application demonstrating basic peripheral usage
- [Bluetooth app](https://github.com/JaagupAverin/gale-bluetooth-app) - application demonstrating basic Bluetooth usage
- [Zephyr fork](https://github.com/JaagupAverin/gale-zephyr) - Zephyr fork with project-specific adjustments
